DM: upon reaching the stairs, read the following:



> [! DM READ]
> You arrive at an ornate staircase. And eventhough this has been a city of almost a million people, you are currently the only one here.
> 
> You shield your eyes for the brigh light shining up into the sky like a beacon. The stairs lead down into the light. The steps appear to be made of wrought iron, and the whole thing is wide enough to accommodate twenty people walking side by side. You are cold from walking and a comfortable glowing warmth radiates from the hole in the ground. Your footsteps echo on the iron as you decent into the light. The stairs end on a marble floor and in front of you is a wooden door with a carving of some kind of fish demon. 


When the players investigate the door read:
> [!DM READ]
An information box pops up over the door. It's like you are in a game, or maybe wearing special contact lenses that pop up informational tooltips. It even has a little X in the corner to close it out.

> [!AI read]
This is a rendition of a [[Kua-Tin]], the dominant species of the [[Borant System]] and principal owners of the [[Borant Corporation]]. Make sure you recognize these guys. Thereâ€™ll be a test later.


The door slams behind the players. A long hallway is revealed. It is lit by multiple torches. The hallway is just as wide and tall as the door itself. It looks more like a tunnel for a double-lane roadway than for someone to walk through. In the distance the players can see several branches leading off the main hall. A blinking light appeared near the first branch.
