# Achievement - I Wanna Go Home!
```
You teleported to a stairwell station within the first thirty hours of the floor being open. What, you’re running away early? I hope for your sake you don’t actually go down the stairs. You know it doesn’t get easier.

Reward: Your reward is advice. Fatherly advice. Don’t be a little bitch. There’s your reward.
