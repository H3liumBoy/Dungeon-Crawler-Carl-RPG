# Achievement - Ultimate Extreme Power!

 
```
	Easy there, Charlemagne. This is only a medium settlement. It’s not like you’ve conquered most of Europe. But you have killed this town’s acting Magistrate.

	You know what that means? Welcome to the wonderful world of public administration.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Tyrant’s Box! You have also gained control of the Medium Skyfowl Settlement. Good luck, Magistrate.
