# Achievement - It’s Elementary, My Dear Crawler!
```
	And you thought all you had to do was bonk monsters on the head.

	You’ve received a quest! Puzzles and intrigue and mysteries, oh my! If you want to survive in this world, you’re going to need to be more than just a pretty, sword-swinging barbarian. Some quests require brute strength, yes, but sometimes you also gotta use your noggin.

	Reward: We don’t want you getting bored. That’s your prize.
