# Achievement - You Can’t Fight City Hall!
```
	But you can sure die trying.

	You have discovered a city boss!

	That’s right. Let me say that again for the assholes in the back!

	A.

	CITY.

	FUCKING.

	BOSS.

	Welp. If you gonna go, you might as well do it with style.

	Just an FYI. As of this moment in the current season of Dungeon Crawler World, not a single Crawler has faced a city boss and survived. And for good reason. Only a complete moron would voluntarily put themselves in a situation where they had to fight one of the most powerful monsters on the level.

	Reward: A lot of people are probably going to watch you die. That’s a better prize than most of us get.
