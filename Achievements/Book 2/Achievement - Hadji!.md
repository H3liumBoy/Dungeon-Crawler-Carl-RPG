# Achievement - Hadji!
```
	You have completed a quest, but you completed it in a way unusual enough to trigger the Hadji Achievement! And like the oft exploited street children of Kolkata, where there’s one, there’s usually more. This is one of the rare achievements that can be rewarded more than once.

	Reward: Your Gold Quest box has been upgraded to a Platinum Quest Box!
