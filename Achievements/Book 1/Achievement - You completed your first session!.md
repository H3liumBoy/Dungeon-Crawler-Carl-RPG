# Achievement - You completed your first session!
```
	You managed to make it all the way through the first Dungeon Crawler Session without kicking the bucket!

	Reward: You get to wait until the next session before you get to enjoy more.

	The good news is the next session probably has clowns and dead hookers in it.
