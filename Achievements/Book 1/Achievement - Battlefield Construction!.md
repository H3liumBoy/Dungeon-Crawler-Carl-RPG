# Achievement - Battlefield Construction!
```
	You built a structure and deployed it in battle. And your mother thought you were wasting your life away while you spent all those hours eating Doritos and playing Minecraft. If only she could see you now. Too bad she’s probably dead.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Mechanic’s Box!
