# Achievement - What goes up...
```
	You have been struck with and survived the dreaded Reverse Gravity Spell. Well, you fared better than Albert II, the first earth mammal to reach space alive. He was a rhesus monkey, in case you’re wondering. He went up just fine. He didn’t stick the landing.

	Reward: You can now tell people you’re more durable than a monkey named Albert.
