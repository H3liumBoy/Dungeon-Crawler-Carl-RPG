# Achievement - Grease Monkey!
```
	Don’t get ahead of yourself, Dale. You built and deployed a wheeled device. When the primitive humans in Mesopotamia made the first wheel, they probably thought they were hot shit, too. It still took them another 5,000 years after that to invent the toilet.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Mechanic’s Box!
