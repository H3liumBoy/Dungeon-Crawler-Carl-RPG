# Achievement - Boss Babe.
```
	You have struck a blow against a dungeon boss and caused damage to it. Here’s a fun fact. For crawlers who make it through the tutorial, this achievement is, by far, most often the last achievement they ever receive. Isn’t that interesting?

	Reward: Let’s wait a few minutes before we decide on whether or not to waste a prize on you.
