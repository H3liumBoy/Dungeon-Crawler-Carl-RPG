# Achievement - Trailblazing Crazy Cat Lady.

```
	You are the first crawler to have entered to the World Dungeon accompanied by a cat. You must really love that thing. Too bad you’re both probably going to die a horrible death at any moment. Or maybe not. Look at the prize you just received!

	Reward: You’ve received a Legendary Pet Box!
