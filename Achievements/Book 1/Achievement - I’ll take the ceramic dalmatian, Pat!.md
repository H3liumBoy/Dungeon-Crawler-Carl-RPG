# Achievement - I’ll take the ceramic dalmatian, Pat!
```
	You have discovered a reward room! Scattered throughout the dungeon, reward rooms offer crawlers items generally not available within loot boxes. Most reward rooms only allow one choice. So, if you’re in a party of multiple people, tell them I said you should get the prize, not them.

	Reward: Don’t be a greedy bitch. The goddamned room is the reward.
