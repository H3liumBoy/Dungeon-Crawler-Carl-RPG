# Achievement - Bitchmeat!
```
	You’ve been attacked by a fellow crawler in a safe zone, and the system has been forced to save your ass. That usually suggests you’re either really annoying, or you snore.

	If this were a prison, you would now be my bitch. Wait…

	Reward: Bitches don’t get rewards.
