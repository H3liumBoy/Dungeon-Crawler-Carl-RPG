# Achievement - Like a Moth to the Flame.
```
	You attacked and caused damage to a mob that is more than 75 levels above your own. The fact that you’re reading this suggests you’re the luckiest fucker in the dungeon. Just remember, luck goes both ways, like your mom.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Lucky Bastard Box!
