# Achievement - Martha Stewart!
```
	You used a workbench to craft for the first time. The next thing you know you’ll be fashioning bottlecap earrings, drinking oat milk, and selling your ugly crap on Etsy while you wax poetic on Instagram about your “journey.”

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Crafter’s Box!
