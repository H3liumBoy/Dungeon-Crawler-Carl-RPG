# Achievement - Who Let the Gods Out?
```
You have allowed a feral god to enter your current realm. That is the equivalent of dropping a grenade down your pants and shouting, “Yolo!”

Here’s a fun fact. Other gods don’t like feral gods. They’ve been thrown into the Nothing for a reason. They tend to react to this sort of thing, depending on who you’ve brought out.

Reward: Whatever is about to happen is going to hit the Dungeon Crawler World blooper reel for sure.
