# Achievement - Indomitable.
```
You have been physically attacked by a deity, and you survived. This is a feat that has only been accomplished by a handful of crawlers in the history of Dungeon Crawler World. Good job! Unfortunately for you and anybody around you, whenever this happens, the other deities tend to notice.

Reward: You have received a Legendary Deityâ€™s Box.
