# Diwata

***A.I. Description***
```
**Diwata! Level 250 Immortal!**

**It’s not only a deity, it’s also the winner of the dungeon’s worst mother _and_ father of the year award! She can’t be killed, but if you can manage to talk her into some sort of birth control, she’ll be knocked out of the ring!**

**Donut: CARL, CARL, DID YOU SEE! I GOT TOP BILLING! AGAIN!**

**Carl: Everybody spread out. Hit Imogen with blunt force attacks. Not magical bolts. Use the beat of the music to coordinate your strikes. Follow Florin’s lead. Katia, Imani, Donut, on me. We take care of Diwata, and then we assist with Imogen.**

**Donut: I’LL HAVE TO USE YOUR _PAWNA’S TEARS_ POTION. I JUST TOOK A _FEATHER FALL_, SO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY POTION COOLDOWN! I TOLD YOU I SHOULD’VE DONE THIS EARLIER, CARL.**
