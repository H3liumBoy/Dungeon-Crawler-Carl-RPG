Trailblazing Crazy Cat Lady.

	You are the first crawler to have entered to the World Dungeon accompanied by a cat. You must really love that thing. Too bad you’re both probably going to die a horrible death at any moment. Or maybe not. Look at the prize you just received!

Unarmed combat.

	So. You just gonna waltz right into something called a “World Dungeon” and you’re not even going to bring a weapon? You’re either braver than you look, or you’re just an idiot. Good luck with that, Van Damme.

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!

Loner.

	You entered the dungeon without any human companions. Didn’t anyone teach you there is safety in numbers?

	Reward: None! Haha. You are so dead.	

Fall into an obvious trap.

	Reward: Well, if there’s a heaven, and if you haven’t been too much of an asshole, maybe they’ll let you in. Because you about to meet your maker.
