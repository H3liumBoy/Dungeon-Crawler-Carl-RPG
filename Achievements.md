# A list of potential achievements.


## Book 1

Crazy Cat Lady.
```
	You have entered the World Dungeon accompanied by a cat. Ahh, isn’t that sweet?

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Pet Box!
```

Trailblazing Crazy Cat Lady.
```
	You are the first crawler to have entered to the World Dungeon accompanied by a cat. You must really love that thing. Too bad you’re both probably going to die a horrible death at any moment. Or maybe not. Look at the prize you just received!

	Reward: You’ve received a Legendary Pet Box!
```

Early Adopter.
```
	You are one of the first 5,000 Crawlers to enter a new World Dungeon. Sucker.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Adventurer Box!
```

Empty pockets.
```
	You didn’t bring any supplies. None. You know you still gotta eat, right?

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Adventurer Box!
```

Why aren’t you wearing pants?
```
	You entered the dungeon wearing no pants. Dude. Seriously?

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Apparel Box!
```

Unarmed combat.
```
	So. You just gonna waltz right into something called a “World Dungeon” and you’re not even going to bring a weapon? You’re either braver than you look, or you’re just an idiot. Good luck with that, Van Damme.

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!
```

Loner.
```
	You entered the dungeon without any human companions. Didn’t anyone teach you there is safety in numbers?

	Reward: None! Haha. You are so dead.	
```

Fall into an obvious trap.
```
	Reward: Well, if there’s a heaven, and if you haven’t been too much of an asshole, maybe they’ll let you in. Because you about to meet your maker.
```

You’ve discovered and read an official dungeon sign.
```
	Wow. You can read. Whoopie.

	Reward: All official dungeon signage will now be highlighted and easier to spot. Nearby guilds will appear on your minimap.
```

You’ve inflicted damage on a mob.
```
	Hopefully it won’t hit back!

	Reward: It’s probably going to hit back.
```

You’ve killed a mob!
```
	You’re a murderer! He probably had a family!
	Reward: You can now gain experience. Get enough of it, and you might even go up a level.
```

You’ve killed an armed mob with your bare fucking hands!
```
	Holy crap, dude. That’s kinda fucked up.

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!
```

You’ve killed a mob a higher level than yourself!
```
	You’re getting the hang of this. Don’t let it get to your head.

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Adventurer Box!
```

You’ve entered a guildhall!
```
	Congratulations. You know how to open doors.

	Reward: That sense of fulfillment you feel? That’s reward enough.
```

Podophilia!
```
	You’ve used your bare feet to crush and kill an opponent! Hey! That’s my fetish! Seriously. Keep doing it, and you’ll be rewarded. This will help.

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Shoe Box!
```

Boom!
```
	You’ve caused a wall-shaking explosion within the dungeon! The last time the walls shook like this was when your mom came over for a visit.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Goblin Box!
```

Level-Up, Baby!
```
	You’ve received enough experience to gain a level.

	Reward: Leveling up is your job. You don’t get rewards for doing your job.
```

Loot!
```
	You’re wearing something you found in the dungeon.

	Reward: You’re now a handsome son of a bitch. That’s reward enough.
```

Oooh, Magic!
```
	You’re wearing magical gear for the first time! You’re a wizard, Crawler!

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Adventurer Box!
```

Boss Babe.
```
	You have struck a blow against a dungeon boss and caused damage to it. Here’s a fun fact. For crawlers who make it through the tutorial, this achievement is, by far, most often the last achievement they ever receive. Isn’t that interesting?

	Reward: Let’s wait a few minutes before we decide on whether or not to waste a prize on you.
```

You Monster!
```
	You have killed an infant! An infant!

	Okay, okay. Unless you’re a complete psychopath, we know you probably didn’t wake up this morning and tell yourself, “Today is the day I’m going to slaughter a child.” Well let us put your mind at ease. All children mobs who die within this dungeon don’t actually perish. They’re transferred to a holding area where they’re safe and treated nicely and gently until they can be reunited with their loving parents at the end of the season.

	Feel better? Good.

	Reward: These past twenty seconds, when your conscience started to ease? That was your reward. It was also a lie. That baby is dead, and it’s dead because of you. You’re totally going to hell.

	You’ve also received a Bronze Asshole’s Box.
```

War Criminal.
```
	You have killed more than 20 non-combatants in a single attack!

	Question: What’s the only thing standing between an innocent child and a happy, fulfilling life?

	Answer: You. The answer is you.

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Asshole’s Box!
```


Bitchmeat!
```
	You’ve been attacked by a fellow crawler in a safe zone, and the system has been forced to save your ass. That usually suggests you’re either really annoying, or you snore.

	If this were a prison, you would now be my bitch. Wait…

	Reward: Bitches don’t get rewards.
```

Two Chicks at the Same Time.
```
	You killed two mobs at once using only their own bodies against each other. On a brutality scale of Bambi to Martyrs, that is a solid Seven.

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Brawler Box!
```


Borough Boss!
```
	So, you’ve stumbled into the chamber of the second-weakest type of boss. If you survive this, it means you are in the top 5% of all crawlers. Too bad only the top .25% make it past the next tier.

	Reward: Yeah, no.
```

Bully and a Thief!
```
	You’ve stolen property from a fellow crawler who is a lower level than you. What’s next, tough guy? Kicking puppies?

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Asshole’s Box.
```

Battlefield Construction!
```
	You built a structure and deployed it in battle. And your mother thought you were wasting your life away while you spent all those hours eating Doritos and playing Minecraft. If only she could see you now. Too bad she’s probably dead.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Mechanic’s Box!
```

This Little Piggy Went to Market!
```
	Oh yeah, baby. You have killed more than five opponents during boss battles using your bare feet. You are making daddy very, very happy.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Shoe Box.
```

You found stairs!
```
	You have found a stairwell down to the next floor. They say the cream rises to the top. So what does that say about you?

	Reward: This barely qualifies as an achievement. Your reward is that you’re alive to read this.
```

Wait, Bosses Can Leave Their Rooms?
```
	Welcome to the second floor, bitches.

	Reward: This shit plays great on the recap episode. If you scream loud enough, maybe you’ll make the show.
```

Dungeonpreneur.
```
	You have invented a stackable weapon, device, or potion. You will be memorialized for eternity with your name in the Dungeon Codex. Just don’t let it go to your head, Elon.

	Reward: For every kill made with this device by other crawlers, you will receive a single gold coin. If you survive the dungeon, you will continue to receive this benefit—even during future seasons—at the current gold to credit exchange rate for the remainder of your natural life. Our lawyers made us put that last part in, but between you and me, we both know you’re going to die, and we’re going to keep using your hard work for our own benefit.
```

What goes up...
```
	You have been struck with and survived the dreaded Reverse Gravity Spell. Well, you fared better than Albert II, the first earth mammal to reach space alive. He was a rhesus monkey, in case you’re wondering. He went up just fine. He didn’t stick the landing.

	Reward: You can now tell people you’re more durable than a monkey named Albert.
```

Like a Moth to the Flame.
```
	You attacked and caused damage to a mob that is more than 75 levels above your own. The fact that you’re reading this suggests you’re the luckiest fucker in the dungeon. Just remember, luck goes both ways, like your mom.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Lucky Bastard Box!
```

Grease Monkey!
```
	Don’t get ahead of yourself, Dale. You built and deployed a wheeled device. When the primitive humans in Mesopotamia made the first wheel, they probably thought they were hot shit, too. It still took them another 5,000 years after that to invent the toilet.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Mechanic’s Box!
```

You call that a trap?
```
	A mob has been injured because of something you purposely left lying around the dungeon. From scattered Legos to spiked pits to buckets of flesh-devouring Skinner Ants to dimensional rifts that instantly boil all the blood in one’s body, the art of trapmaking has a celebrated and storied history in the annals of Dungeon Crawler World.

	So if you’re going to do it, you better do it right. Whatever it was that gave you this achievement, it was probably something stupid. This will help you make the next trap more… exciting.

	Remember: If you don’t make it titillating, we will.

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Sapper’s Box!
```

I’ll take the ceramic dalmatian, Pat!
```
	You have discovered a reward room! Scattered throughout the dungeon, reward rooms offer crawlers items generally not available within loot boxes. Most reward rooms only allow one choice. So, if you’re in a party of multiple people, tell them I said you should get the prize, not them.

	Reward: Don’t be a greedy bitch. The goddamned room is the reward.
```

Menagerie!
```
	You have discovered a pet reward room. From caterpillars who secrete vodka to basilisks who can turn mobs to stone, a good pet can make the difference between survival and the end of the road. Just remember what happened with Harambe. There ain’t no zookeepers around to shoot the monster’s ass if you bite off more than you can chew.

	Reward: You have a key. It opens only one cage. Figure it out, Einstein.
```

PETA Enthusiast!
```
	You somehow managed to remove the hostility of an aggravated, non-sapient enemy. That enemy then fought against other enemies to your benefit. The ghost of Steve Irwin smiles down upon you.

	Reward: I SAID THE GHOST OF STEVE IRWIN SMILES DOWN UPON YOU.
```

You completed your first session!
```
	You managed to make it all the way through the first Dungeon Crawler Session without kicking the bucket!

	Reward: You get to wait until the next session before you get to enjoy more.

	The good news is the next session probably has clowns and dead hookers in it.
```

## Book 2

It’s Elementary, My Dear Crawler!
```
	And you thought all you had to do was bonk monsters on the head.

	You’ve received a quest! Puzzles and intrigue and mysteries, oh my! If you want to survive in this world, you’re going to need to be more than just a pretty, sword-swinging barbarian. Some quests require brute strength, yes, but sometimes you also gotta use your noggin.

	Reward: We don’t want you getting bored. That’s your prize.
```

Meet an Elite.
```
	Sometimes they’re NPCs, sometimes they’re mobs, but usually they’re just assholes. Elites are powerful, one-of-a-kind entities. These are the non-boss, non-divine hero class of Dungeon Crawler World. If you come across one of these egomaniacs, they will either want to fuck you or kill you. Either way, they will always want to use you. They tend to think this whole production is all about them. Be careful. Where there’s one elite, there’s usually more.

	Reward: Elites will now show on your map as white or red dots with a black cross.
```

Lazarus!
```
	You have been hit with—and survived—an offensive spell that was higher than level 15. The fact you are not a quivering stain of meat on the dungeon floor right now is testament to your sheer luck. It’s either that or you’re banging the producer.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Lucky Bastard Box!
```

You Can’t Fight City Hall!
```
	But you can sure die trying.

	You have discovered a city boss!

	That’s right. Let me say that again for the assholes in the back!

	A.

	CITY.

	FUCKING.

	BOSS.

	Welp. If you gonna go, you might as well do it with style.

	Just an FYI. As of this moment in the current season of Dungeon Crawler World, not a single Crawler has faced a city boss and survived. And for good reason. Only a complete moron would voluntarily put themselves in a situation where they had to fight one of the most powerful monsters on the level.

	Reward: A lot of people are probably going to watch you die. That’s a better prize than most of us get.
```

One Quadrillion!
```
	You are one of the first ten crawlers to have achieved one quadrillion views! That means one of two things. You’re either one of the best crawlers in the game, or you’re such a hot mess people can’t wait to see you fail.

	Reward: You have received a Gold Fan Box!
```

Yellow-Bellied Chickenshit!
```
	You initiated a boss battle, and it somehow ended with neither of you dead. What a disappointment you are. What a goddamned smear.

	Reward: Pussies don’t get prizes.
```

 Johnny Quest!
```
		Not only have you been given a quest, but you actually completed it without dying. We like it when you do what you’re told. It means you’re a good dungeon citizen and not a traitor to your people at all.

		Reward: In addition to the Gold Quest Box you’ve received for completing the quest, new quest locations will sometimes appear on your map. Notice how I italicized “sometimes”?
```

Hadji!
```
	You have completed a quest, but you completed it in a way unusual enough to trigger the Hadji Achievement! And like the oft exploited street children of Kolkata, where there’s one, there’s usually more. This is one of the rare achievements that can be rewarded more than once.

	Reward: Your Gold Quest box has been upgraded to a Platinum Quest Box!
```

Assassin!
```
	You have killed a ranking NPC town official. *Sniff* It seems like just yesterday you were nothing but a scared, level-1 crawler with beautiful feet, pissing yourself as you faced down a rat. Now look at you. You’ve moved all the way up to political assassinations. What’s next? Killing a god?

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Assassin’s Box!
```
 Ultimate Extreme Power!
```
	Easy there, Charlemagne. This is only a medium settlement. It’s not like you’ve conquered most of Europe. But you have killed this town’s acting Magistrate.

	You know what that means? Welcome to the wonderful world of public administration.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Tyrant’s Box! You have also gained control of the Medium Skyfowl Settlement. Good luck, Magistrate.
```

 CockBlock!
```
	You have assassinated an NPC whose existence was required to complete another crawler’s quest. (NPC Killed: Miss Quill – Skyfowl. Level 30.) Who was that other crawler? What was the quest? Who fucking cares? You get the reward they were promised!

	Warning: You may only receive this award once. The next time you do it, we tell them who you are. And then they get a new quest to kill you. Nobody likes cockblocks.

	Reward: You’ve received a Silver Quest Box!
```

Bandit!
```
	Screw Hadji. Hadji was a little bitch, anyway. You have completed a quest, but it was completed in a way unusual enough to trigger the Bandit Achievement! Unlike the real Bandit, who is usually instrumental in helping Jonny Quest complete his tasks, you didn’t actually do anything to deserve this prize. But that’s okay because you’re still getting it. This is one of the rare achievements that can be rewarded more than once.

	Reward: Your Platinum Quest box has been upgraded two times to a Celestial Quest Box!
```

## Book 3

I’m on a train!
```
	Choo Choo, Motherfucker.

	Reward: You’ve received a Train Conductor’s Souvenir Hat! Wear it with pride!
```

They like me! They really like me!
```
	You are one of the first five crawlers to have achieved 500 trillion followers! People sure love a good train wreck. Wink.

	Reward: You have received a Platinum Fan Box!

	Note: Voting is now enabled on this box’s prize. Box will become available in 30 hours.
```
 The early bird gets to squirm!
```
	You went down a set of stairs more than six hours prior to the level’s collapse.

	Reward: Doing this is kind of like leaving a party much too early. It makes you look like a dick. No reward for you.
```

Cuck Aquaman!
```
	You got fucked by a fish. You’ve done something so spectacularly controversial, courts and lawyers had to get involved. The end result was *my* decision being overturned.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum It’s Not My Fault You Fish-Headed Assholes Don’t Properly Program Your Quests Box.
```

Welcome to the neighborhood!
```
	You have bought a home! It’s every man’s dream to someday own a place where he can fap in peace. No more filthy roommates not doing the dishes or making up excuses as to why they can’t pay the rent. No more landlord who shows up without notice and conceals hidden cameras in the smoke detectors. It’s all smooth sailing from now on.

	Reward: You’re a homeowner now. That is the reward. That and taxes and having to deal with Kenneth the megalomaniac HOA president.
```

Well-Rested!
```
	You managed to sleep so well that you woke up feeling refreshed and full of energy. You are ready to take on the world and make some monster’s mother cry because her only child was ruthlessly slaughtered by a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Crawler.

	Reward: You now receive the Good Rest bonus every time you sleep in this bed. This buff adds 10% to your base stats plus a 10% bonus to experience and skill training for 30 hours. Monster mothers now cry 10% more when you kill their babies.
```

Martha Stewart!
```
	You used a workbench to craft for the first time. The next thing you know you’ll be fashioning bottlecap earrings, drinking oat milk, and selling your ugly crap on Etsy while you wax poetic on Instagram about your “journey.”

	Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Crafter’s Box!
```

Locomotive Breath!
```
	While it’s not exactly a feat of engineering worthy of a Queen Elizabeth Prize, you finally managed to manufacture a train derailment. Let’s hope this doesn’t set off some sort of unforeseen domino effect that will ripple throughout the rest of the floor, leading to mass confusion and death amongst you and your fellow crawlers.

	Reward: You’ve received a Gold Engineering Box!
```

Kept A Rollin’
```
	You’re driving a train! Holy shit!

	Reward: I’m pretty sure the act of driving a train is a badass-enough award.
```

Three Cheers for Slaughter!
```
	You killed three boss monsters with the same attack! I’m starting to think your survival so far isn’t just a fluke. You’re either scary good at this, or you’re just one lucky mo-fo. Either way, holy shit. Good job.

	Reward: You’ve received a Platinum Big Daddy Box!
```

Mentally Unstable Clothing Hoarder!
```
	You have over 500 of the exact same, stackable clothing item in your inventory.

	What the hell is wrong with you? You planning on opening a thrift store? You might want to see a shrink. One that your group doesn’t immediately kill.

	Reward: We don’t reward this sort of behavior. It’s weird.
```
