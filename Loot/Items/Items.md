```
My safe word is, “Harder, Daddy.”

You know what these are. Your mom had a pair in her drawer, and your dad was probably no stranger to these things, either.

Used to lock a person’s arms together at the wrist. This set of novelty handcuffs is magically reinforced. Requires a strength of at least 200 to break. There’s no key. These are locked and unlocked magically by you. You may also institute an optional safe word or phrase that disengages.

This knob is pretty nice. When attached to a door, it allows a user to
open that door with the strength of the nearest animal. For example, if
there is a cow nearby, the user will have the "strength of a cow" while
opening this door.
