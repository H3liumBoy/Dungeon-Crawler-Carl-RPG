# Enchanted Anarchistâ€™s Battle Rattle

***A.I. Description***
This sleeveless jacket in its current form only offers meager protections compared to some other items of this caliber. However, its ability to host as many upgrade patches as you can fit makes this one of the best, most upgradeable protection items in the game.

### Effects
The plain, unadorned version of this jacket imbues the following effects:

```
+1 to all base stats.
This base stat upgrade increases by +1 for every compatible patch that is added to this jacket. If an eligible Back Patch is added, this benefit is doubled.
Access to the Desperado Club
Access to the Naughty Boys Employment Agency
+50% range and accuracy for all thrown explosives.
```
