A.I. description:

```
The Chee. cute and fluffy. They were a peaceful people. Carpenters, mostly. But then the High Elves wanted their land, and that was that. What happened to them next is a pretty awful story.

There are no Chee left in this realm. There are survivors of that night, when the High-Elves invaded their land. But there are no Chee.

So I’m going to assume you know what a werewolf is. This isn’t a werewolf. Or maybe it is. It’s a were-kin. That’s all you know until either he tells you what he turns into, or he shows you what he turns into, or he bites you, and you find out for yourself.
