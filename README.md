# Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-RPG 
_The apocalypse will be televised!_

Dungeon Crawler Carl is a litrpg written by Matt Dinniman. This book makes me want to play D&D in the world painted by Matt Dinniman.

My goal is to create a Dungeon Crawler Carl inspired D&D Adventure. The story is based on the adventures in the books, but is tweaked to make it fit my own DM needs. I have no intent on using this commercialy. Feel free to correct or add to this project if you like, now go out there and KILL, KILL, KILL!

The start of the adventure can be found under the folder "Dungeon Floors". 

Once downloaded this project can best be viewed in the free notetaking app [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/)
