GC, BWR, NW Princess Donut the Queen Anne Chonk is the secondary protagonist of Dungeon Crawler Carl. She is a tortoiseshell Persian cat that belonged to [[Carl|Carl's]] ex-girlfriend Bea, and is the party leader of The Royal Court of Princess Donut.



== Description ==
Donut was an ordinary, if not rather picky cat that belonged to Bea, Carl's ex-girlfriend. After Bea left their apartment, Donut was being kept by Carl and had quite the lifestyle. Before the Collapse, Donut ran outside to the open (maybe sensing what was about to happen) and Carl chased after her. Falling into the dungeon and somehow entering into the Tutorial Room before Carl, she was cleaning herself when Carl pulled out the  [[Enhanced Pet Biscuit]]. Before he could decide to sell it, Donut bit it out of his hand and underwent a transformation which gave her sapience and the ability to talk via the [[Enhanced Growth|Enhanced Growth buff]]. The Dungeon recognizes her as a Crawler and gave her several loot boxes. She was also as designated the party leader due to having the higher total stats.

== Personality ==
Due to the biscuit and realizing that her life before hand was nothing but just laying about doing nothing special, Donut was rather rude towards Carl. Almost to the point where Carl wanted to leave Donut behind in the dungeon to strike out on his own. She apologized and they have been working together (with some hiccups) to survive. While Donut has moments where she can charm NPCs to give the group what she wants, she can also be extremely abrasive in less then opportune moments. 

Being a cat, she is rather vain, caring about how things look on her and being appalled if they do not look good. Donut does not like getting dirty or being hurt so she is more comfortable fighting from a distance with her magic.
