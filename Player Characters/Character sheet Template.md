### Background: How did they get to the crawl

Was doing a late night walk talking to themself and everything just dropped; houses, trees, light posts, phone lines, etc. All the lights went out when they spotted the only light source. With no cell phone signal and home and only their dog there was nothing else to lose but to enter The World Dungeon.
