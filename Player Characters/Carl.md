Carl is the titular protagonist of Dungeon Crawler Carl. 
== Description ==
Before entering The [[Dungeon]], Carl served in the US Coast Guard, then worked as a Marine Technician "fixing electrical systems for rich assholes and their party boats."<ref>Dungeon Crawler Carl (p. 2). Kindle Edition</ref>. He lived with his girlfriend Bea (Beatrice) and her award-winning cat [[Donut|Princess Donut]]. He survived the collapse because [[Donut|Princess Donut]] had escaped the apartment and he was outside looking for her. He is an Acolyte of [[Emberus]].

== Personality ==
Carl is a gruff man who has a strong sense of right and wrong. He also has "grit", refusing to let the system break him. While not charismatic, he is the sort who will assume leadership if nobody else steps up. He is a loyal and trustworthy crawler, willing to take risks if he can help others, which engenders a great deal of loyalty from other crawlers. Many describe him as "crazy" due to the risks he takes and the creative, albeit half-baked, plans he hatches.
