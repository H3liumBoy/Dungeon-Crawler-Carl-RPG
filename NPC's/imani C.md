Imani is another caretaker from [[Meadow Lark]]. She is one of [[Carl]] and [[Donut]]'s oldest allies, having received their help rescuing the elderly under her care.

When she is first introduced, she has a relatively high level and has already killed 12 crawlers, all her own residents, but they were mercy killings. She is a healer at heart, but will do whatever is necessary.
