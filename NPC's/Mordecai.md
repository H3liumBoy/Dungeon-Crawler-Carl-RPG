Mordecai – Rat Hooligan. Level 50.

Guildmaster of this guildhall.

This is a Non-Combatant NPC.

Hooligans are the smartest, fastest, and ugliest of the Rat-Kin race. While not as roided-out as a Rat Brute, or as Imma fireball yo ass as a Rat Shaman, Rat Hooligans offer the best of both worlds. They are physically strong, and they have a decent grasp of magic.



He is a level 50 Guild Master and currently [[Donut|Princess Donut]]'s [[Manager Benefit|Manager]]. He is currently on his last tour of crawl duty.

== Description ==
Mordecai is [[Carl]] and [[Donut]]’s guide for the dungeon. He is an indentured servant for [[Borant]], tasked with helping the corporation run crawls. Originally an avian race called a [[Skyfowl]], Mordecai chose [[Changeling]] as his race when he was a crawler. Now as a guide he is forced into a different race each floor. His chosen area of expertise during his crawl was potion making, but since becoming a guide, that expertise has grown over hundreds of years to cover most aspects of the crawl. According to [[Odette]], he is one of the most knowledgeable guides there are.

Normally Mordecai is a tutorial guide for the first two floors and serves as a guild master on the later floors, where he has relative freedom to follow his own pursuits in potion making and catch up with friends. Following Odette’s advice, [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] made Mordecai into [[Donut]]’s [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] during the class selection process, meaning he must stay on as advisor even after the second floor. They had to make it look like an accident. He didn't take it well, but he didn't blame them. Odette warns them that he is only useful to them if he wants to help, and if he ever learns that they made him [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] on purpose, he will turn his resentment to them and refuse to help any further.

Mordecai is generally grumpy but tends to perk up when talking about potions. He gets emotional when he’s drunk, thinking about the loss of his family. He was traumatized during his time as a crawler. Hundreds of years later, he still holds a grudge against his former allies, whom he blames for the death of his brother. This includes Odette, his former [[Manager Benefit|Manager]]. It is implied that part of why he hates the idea of being [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] is because of his resentment toward her. He lashes out against his former allies when given a chance.

He is committed to helping [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] survive the crawl, even if they don’t always take his advice. Potion brewing is a time-consuming process, but he regularly brews potions for them, which have helped The Royal Court out of many situations. His specific knowledge about the crawl is very useful when [[Carl]] is trying to make plans or understand how dangerous a situation is. Since getting the Anarchist’s Cookbook, [[Carl]] has begun hiding some of his use of the book by guiding conversations to make it look like Mordecai is providing the information instead. Mordecai’s general advice is conservative, aimed at surviving as long as possible while minimizing risk. This is increasingly at odds with [[Carl]]’s desire to take risks to accumulate power, save as many lives as possible, and tear down the whole concept of the crawl. The many unprecedented situations [[Carl]] gets himself into are starting to make Mordecai feel irrelevant.
