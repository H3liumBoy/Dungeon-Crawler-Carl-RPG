Agatha is a mystery. She initially appears to be a homeless woman pushing a shopping cart. She started a fire outside of the [[Meadow Lark]] care facility that caused an evacuation, saving the caretakers and residents of that facility.

Irregularities quickly crop up around her, however. She does not show up on the daily [[Dungeon]] recap episodes, the TV feeds seem to cut out when she is around, and she has several items from the [[Valtay|Valtay Corporation]] in her shopping cart, indicating she may be either working for [[Valtay]] or actually be the host to a symbiotic worm that is wearing her body.
