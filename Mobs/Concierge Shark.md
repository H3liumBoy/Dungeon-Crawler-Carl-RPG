Concierge Shark

Description
These psychos are of the bite-first, ask-questions-later school of underwater diplomacy.

Also known as the “Death’s Welcoming Committee Shark,” the Concierge Shark is one of the fastest and most voracious of the ocean’s predators. They’ll eat anything. ANYTHING. Even those circus peanut candy things. It’s really kind of gross.

They are attracted to the scent of blood, making them the most common death dealers of any water-themed dungeon.
