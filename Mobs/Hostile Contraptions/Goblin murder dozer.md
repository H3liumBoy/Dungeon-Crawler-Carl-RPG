AI Description:
```
Goblin Murder Dozer. Contraption.

A goblin-built, steam-powered machine designed to mow down and slaughter unsuspecting dungeon crawlers. I hope you’re up to date with your tetanus shots.
```

The machine is the size of a tractor and runs on treads, like a tank. The thing is built out of mismatched, rusting hunks of metal, and it looks as if it could fall apart at any moment. A spinning, spike-covered wheel dominated the front of the death machine.


For visibility, the bulldozer is fitted with several video cameras linked to two monitors mounted on the vehicle's dashboard. The cameras aree protected on the outside by 3-inch shields of magic-resistant plastic. Compressed air nozzles are fitted to blow dust away from the video cameras.
