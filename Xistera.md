# xistera

A wicker-like scoop, two feet long, that a player can attach to his hand and arm. It is used for throwing projectiles with high speed and accuracy. When a player summons something from his inventory into his hand it goes right into the scoop, which adjusts itself to accommodate the projectile. When not in use the xistera can fold inward onto the player's forearm and form a bracer, which leaves his hand free and allows him to summon his gauntlet.
