Astral Paw is a telekinesis spell that mimics the paw of an animal. At higher levels it becomes a potent attack spell.

Description
Cost: unknown

Target: empty space within spell radius, about 10 meters at level 1.

Duration: unknown

Allows the caster to manipulate objects at a distance as if they were touching them with a paw. It can be used as a weapon and is stronger in that regard compared to Astral Hand because it lacks the latter's fine motor control. At level 5, it can grow claws. At level 10, it can be made much larger. At level 15, the caster's skills and abilities are translated directly into the paw.
