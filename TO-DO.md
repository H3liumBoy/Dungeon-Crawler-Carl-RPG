## Potions

- [[Weapon Oil: Weeping Wound]]
- Skill Potion.
AI Description:
```
Drinking this adds a single level to the Determine Value skill. Hopefully now you’ll realize all those Magic: The Gathering cards are nothing more than just meaningless pieces of paper, and you should have spent your money on something with actual value, like a treadmill. Or shampoo.
```

## Antidote
[[Poison Antidote]]

## Scrolls


## Magic Thomes
- [[Tome of Magic Missile]]
- [[Tome of Wisp Armor]]


## Food
[[Crawler Biscuits]]

[[Regular pet biscuits]]
```
Regular Biscuits feed pet-based classes for a full day. Pets find them delicious. They smell them, and they’ll just gobble them up.
```

[[enhanced pet biscuit]]
```
Properties:
Enhanced Pet Biscuit.

So, it looks like a regular pet biscuit. It’s not.

Feed to your pet at your own risk. What’s the worst that can happen?

Effect:
Enhanced treats have over 100 different possible effects. Half of them are good. The rest are… neutral… or decidedly bad. But if there’s a bad outcome, your pet won’t attack you if you feed them the treat while you’re in a safe zone. Your pet will be teleported outside to a random place within a square mile of here. If you feed it to her while you’re out on crawl, and she transforms into a toothed fleshbutcher, you’re pretty much fucked.
```

## Misc

[[Torch]]
[[Dynamite]]
[[Lighter]]

[[Goblin Pass]]

AI Description:
```
It’s a tattoo! On your forearm! Now you’ll never get a good job!

Note: Pass tattoos cannot be hidden unless you purchase a coverup sleeve. Will show through any armor you may wear.

Removes automatic goblin hostility. Allows for free passage through goblin-controlled territory in the dungeon. Warning: holding a Goblin Pass will cause natural goblin enemies, such as fairy-class creatures, to deal 20% more damage against you. Still, it looks kinda badass.
```

Properties
```
The Goblin Pass took the form of a goblin-shaped skull.

When activated, instead of adding itself to your inventory, it flies and smacked up against your left inner forearm. You are still wearing yourclothes, but you can feel it burning against your skin, like you are being branded. The logo also appears on the exterior of your clothes. The pain quickly abated, and your clothes are otherwise undamaged.
```

[[Desperado Pass]]
AI Description:
```
Desperado Pass.

Great. Now you’re running with the type of kids who sit in the back of the bus. What would your mother say?

This pass allows access to the Desperado Club.

Warning: Holding a Desperado Pass negates the ability to obtain a Vanquisher pass.
