Bang Bro is an enchantment spell that adds fire and electrical damage to an equipped item.

***AI Description***
```
Cost: 5 Mana

Target: Temporarily Enchant Equipped Item

Duration: 5 minutes + 1 minute per level of spell. Requires 5 minute cooldown.

Adds both fire and electrical damage to any currently-equipped item. May not be cast on flesh. Well, actually it can be cast on (your own) flesh, but I really wouldnâ€™t recommend it. May inflict Burn and Shock on targets.

Can also be used to cook hotdogs and other items.
