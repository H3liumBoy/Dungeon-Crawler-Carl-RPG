# Hole

Hole is a utility spell that makes a hole in a surface. Obtained by Donut on Floor 4 through her membership to the Dungeon Book of the Floor Club.

Description
Cost: Unknown amount of mp per second (Donut can use it continuously for about 5 minutes near the beginning of floor 4)

Target: Any surface within spell radius

Duration: Variable, can be canceled at will

Allows the caster to instantly carve a cylindrical volume, a hole, out of a surface of their choosing. The diameter of the hole by default is about the size of a manhole cover, but it can be changed with practice. The depth of the hole scales at 3cm per spell level. At level 1 it creates more of a dimple in most surfaces rather than a hole. When the spell ends the hole disappears, leaving the affected area undamaged.

Anything that can fit in the hole created by the spell can pass through it, but the spell can also be used offensively to create portal cuts. When the spell ends it destroys any matter that's occupying the space created by the spell.
