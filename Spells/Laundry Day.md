Description
Cost: unknown

Target: Someone wearing armor, line of sight

Duration: unknown

Removes a random piece of armor from the target and causes it to fall on the floor. The effectiveness of the spell scales with level. Initially it can only target minor pieces of armor, but at level 5 it can target breastplates or the equivalent. At level 10, it can strip an opponent bare. At level 15, it can target multiple opponents.

Crawler Tin, of the 21st edition of the Cookbook, also theorizes that since the gods and goddesses are technically Soul Armor, any spell that targets biological armor, like Laundry Day, should in theory be able to remove a sponsor from the deity they are piloting as long as their invulnerability is first neutralized.
