Clockwork Triplicate is a utility spell that creates duplicates of a pet or minion. Obtained by Donut on Floor3 through her membership to the Dungeon Book of the Floor Club.

Description
Cost: 26 mp

Target: Pets and minions controlled by the caster

Duration: 1 minute per spell level

Creates two clockwork duplicates of the target. When the spell is cast, the target appears to split into three. The duplicates look and behave the same as the target but act independently. The system does not identify which one is real. When the spell ends, the replicas break into gears and servos and electric parts that disintegrate into a little pile of ash .

If something else cancels the spell prematurely, the replicas explode in a shower of parts that can cause minor damage.

Level 5 Upgrade: Duration increases to 2 minutes per spell level
